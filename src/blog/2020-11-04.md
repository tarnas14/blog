**[oracle]** when using 'not equal' comparisons `<>` and `!=` in the `where` clause, oracle will also remove `NULL` values. i.e.
```sql
select * from someTable where hello <> 'world';
```
will only return non-null values of `hello` column

yes, it should be obvious to me, but I forgot and rediscovered this (probably again)
