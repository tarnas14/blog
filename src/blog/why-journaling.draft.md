I've been journaling privately for the past couple years, I love the [Bullet Journal](https://bulletjournal.com/) practice and what it's doing to my life.

Recently, I've done an experiment on non-private journaling.

For the past 6 months I've been writing a journal that was public to the entire company I've been working with.
Apparently there were even some people who read some of it.

I need to admit: it wasn't entirely my idea, I got it from this *brilliant* [post about working remotely](https://x-team.com/blog/remote-team-guide/).
In the [communication chapter](https://x-team.com/blog/remote-team-guide-communication/), they propose that

> Journaling is the ultimate solution to help teams build trust, collaborate more, and share their daily progress.

## Value

As I'd suspected, I got a lot of value from that company-wide journal:
- it lets me reliably go back and see what's been happening in the team / project / organisation
- it opens a way to see if and how my perception and opinions change over time
- when I feel overwhelmed with what's going on, it is a place where I can dump my brain and focus back on working
- it makes it easier to share thoughts and ideas in the company - once they're written down, I can just send someone a link and we can start talking about it once they've read it
