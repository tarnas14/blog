Back in the **2018** together with a couple colleagues we set out to make a positive impact on the Polish IT world.
We wanted to move focus from technology to actually providing value for your users and customers or, more broadly, _stakeholders_.

Spoiler alert: we didn't change the world...

However, that initiative gave birth to [dostarczajwartosc.pl](dostarczajwartosc.pl) _(eng: delivervalue[.pl])_.
This was a blog coupled together with a [podcast](https://www.buzzsprout.com/222677) where we shared our thoughts and ideas and interviewed interesting people.

I wrote 3 posts on that blog, which I also wanted to share on my personal blog, because why not :)
Maybe I'll reintroduce them here in English if I find some time and motivation.

## [Zwiększ szanse realizacji swoich pomysłów](https://dostarczajwartosc.pl/zwieksz-szanse-realizacji-swoich-pomyslow/)
_Increase the chances of realising your ideas_

_Synopsis:_
This is a story of how I got really demotivated and decided to fight it by creating positive peer pressure.
I dreamt up a series of events where people who wanted to be productive could meet and work on their stuff.
Didn't matter if everybody was working on different things or we worked together on a project.
This was enough to make a small group of people feel motivated.
The events, called "Świątynia Napierdalania" _(eng: A Temple of f***ing doing things)_, are still happening (on and off) in 2021.

## [Jak zespołowo zwalczyliśmy barierę językową w komunikacji z anglojęzycznym klientem](https://dostarczajwartosc.pl/jak-zespolowo-zwalczylismy-bariere-jezykowa-w-komunikacji-z-anglojezycznym-klientem/)
_How we broke the language barrier as a team_

_Synopsis:_
This is a case study of one of my first teams and our communication problems with an English speaking client.
We had one or two people who could speak English fairly fluently, but the rest of the team often sat silent on bigger meetings.
We scheduled one day every week when the whole internal communication was done in English.
We called that day _the English Monday_ (later we moved from Monday to Wednesday, but the name remained the same).
The tradition stuck with the team and really helped us communicate with the client, but it had a positive impact on our internal communication as well.

## [Jak dzielić się wiedzą, gdy czujesz że jeszcze nie pora](https://dostarczajwartosc.pl/jak-dzielic-sie-wiedza-gdy-czujesz-ze-jeszcze-nie-pora/)
_How to share your knowledge when you feel it's too early_

_Synopsis:_
In this post I wrote about the benefits of sharing your knowledge and experience for your own benefit.
Additionally, I shared my thoughts about the tendency of less experienced people to NOT participate in meetups as speakers, because they feel that _"I don't know enough to share my knowledge"_.
In my opinion this is a harmful notion that slows your progress and robs the community of your experience and thoughts.
I stand my ground on this subject to this day, although the covid years were brutal for meetups and conferences.
