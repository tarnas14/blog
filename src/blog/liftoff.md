Hi there, I'm Mateusz Tarnaski, most people call me Tarnas.

I'm a web developer by trade and a snowboarder by heart.

I finally bit the bullet and decided to start a blog (the one I'd been telling myself to start for some time now).

## What I think will happen on this blog

Given my professional inclinations, I'll most likely write about
- web development
- leading and managing a team
- communication
- figuring out requirements and planning work
- decomposing problems and making them measurable and actionable

For a (possibly long) while, I'll most likely be 'just' **journaling** on these topics.

I'm not ready to pump out long posts, it's already taking me *way too long* to write this short note.

## The journey begins

I'm not sure what this blog becomes.
I think it's going to be mostly a place where I can post little rants and store away thoughts and ideas away for future [re-]examination.

Possibly, once I get into the habit of writing, I might do deeper dives on subjects that I find really important.

Either that, or I write 3 posts in the next 2 months never to come back here again xD

Fingers crossed...
